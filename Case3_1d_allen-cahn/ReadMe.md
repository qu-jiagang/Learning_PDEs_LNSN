## One-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation

$$
\begin{split}
	&u_t = \gamma (\Delta u+\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}f(U)),\quad (x,t)\in[-1,1]\times(0,T] \\
	&f(u) = (1-u^2)u
\end{split}
$$

#### Boundary Conditions: 

* Dirichlet Boundary:  Chebyshev spectral method is used for numerical calculation.

$$
u(-1,t)=-1;\ u(1,t)=1
$$

#### Initial Conditions:

There are 3 different initial conditions are considered:

```python
u_initial[0] = 0.53*x+0.47*sin(-1.5*pi*x)
u_initial[2] = 0.62*x+0.38*sin(-1.5*pi*x)
u_initial[2] = 0.68*x+0.32*sin(-1.5*pi*x)
```

The dataset from first initial condition (```u_initial[0]```) is used for training, and the other are used for testing.
